This repo contains two [Keyboard Maestro][km] macros to control Safari on Mac
OS X.

`Toggle iPad UA.kmmacro` toggles between the Mobile Safari for iPad user agent
string and the default Safari user agent string. I keep this bound to
&#8984;<!--cmd-->. in Safari.

`Open in Google Chrome.kmmacro` opens Safari's frontmost tab in Google Chrome.
I keep this bound to &#8984;<!--cmd-->&#8679;<!--shift-->. in Safari.
